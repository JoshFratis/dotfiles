- In order to apply changes to VS, you need to restart the IDE. Might be able to source it. 
- Can't seem to map '/' (with '/' or '_') at least in VS. 
- Can't seem to escape visual mode after some commands in VS. 
- Some commands in VS were working and now they are not. Seems like some key combos are not being handled by vsvim. But I should be able to just put those in keyboard config.
