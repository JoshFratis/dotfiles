--- Vim --- 
- add shift + enter insert line (add with vim for all editors)
- <leader>u to swap case (is there a motion for single character?)
- unbind space from default behavior 
- can i highlight all motions ?
- any way to brighten line numbers?
- wrap in opening/closing characters in visual line mode does not work
- nnoremap Y y$
- remap _ to motion to the beginning of the line-- could also just start using ^ for motion / movement (probably better solution) 
	- nnoremap d_ d^
	- nnoremap y_ y^
	- nnoremap c_ c^

--- Visual Studio ---
- enter normal mode after ctrl+/
- ctrl M always goes backwards 
- fix entering visual mode when using *, gd, ctrl M
- add shift + enter insert line
- increase brightness of cursor and line numbers 
- I want ctrl+/ to insert "// " instead of "//"
- autosave on navigate away ? 
- add highlight yank 
- add realtime replace
- delete by tab / insert tabs not spaces with tab 
- escape sets cursor to beginning of line 

-- Theme --
currently using OneDarkPro-- I like it
still isn't totally working, probably just needs time 

--- Rider --- 
- add realtime replace
- rename does not work
- tab no longer works in the alt+enter menu
- tab works weird in find references menu (takes 3 tabs to tab through one entry)
- shortcut to go to documentation ?

--- General --- 
come up with mappings that actually work across IDEs for the essential common commands
