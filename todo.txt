--- Vim --- 
- can i highlight all motions ?
- paste and format should return cursor to paste position
- need faster double press on hold
- need incremental search not to happen if I'm in visual mode (when using :s)
- command for deleting / yanking everything on the line, but not the entire line itself (for pasting on another line without replacing it)

-- Known Issues --
- wrap in opening/closing characters in visual line mode does not work
	- will not work in VsVim

--- Visual Studio ---
- highlight color
- current line color 
- exit visual mode + enter normal mode after ctrl+/
- add highlight yank 
- add realtime replace
- delete by tab / insert tabs not spaces with tab 
- fix escape sets cursor to beginning of line 

-- Known Issues --
gd enters visual mode. Remapping to vsc or adding <Esc> after gd does not change behavior. 

-- Theme --
currently using OneDarkPro-- I like it
still isn't totally working, probably just needs time 

--- Rider --- 
- shift+enter only working on BFG machine
- add rider settings to dotfile repo and apply scripts
- somehow record all setting changes from defaults in this repo
- add realtime replace
- rename does not work
- brighten line numbers
- tab no longer works in the alt + enter menu
- tab works weird in find references menu (takes 3 tabs to tab through one entry)
- shortcut to go to documentation ?
- don't add default case when auto filling switch statements
- automatically autofill switch statements when adding a parameter

--- Unity ---
have the inspector selector default to assets instead of scene? seems to be the case at work?

--- General --- 
come up with mappings that actually work across IDEs for the essential common commands
