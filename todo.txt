--- Vim --- 
- unbind space from default behavior 
- can i highlight all motions ?
- wrap in opening/closing characters in visual line mode does not work

--- Visual Studio ---
- highlight color
- any way to brighten current line number?
- enter normal mode after ctrl+/
- ctrl M always goes backwards 
- fix entering visual mode when using *, gd, ctrl M
- add shift + enter insert line
- increase brightness of cursor and line numbers 
- I want ctrl+/ to insert "// " instead of "//"
- autosave on navigate away ? 
- add highlight yank 
- add realtime replace
- delete by tab / insert tabs not spaces with tab 
- escape sets cursor to beginning of line 
- is there a way to make the highlighting less opaque? probably a theme thing?

still isn't totally working, probably just needs time 

--- Rider --- 
- add realtime replace
- rename does not work
- brighten line numbers
- tab no longer works in the alt+enter menu

- shortcut to go to documentation ?

--- Unity ---
have the inspector selector default to assets instead of scene? seems to be the case at work?

--- General --- 
come up with mappings that actually work across IDEs for the essential common commands
